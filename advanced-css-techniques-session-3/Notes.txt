--> Git and Github:

-> Git: It is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source
version control system and used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. 

Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers 
to work together on non-linear development. Linus Torvalds created Git in 2005 for the development
of the linux kernel.

--> Features of Git:

 1. Track history
 2. Free and Open source
 3. Supports non-linear development
 4. Creates backups
 5. Scalable
 6. Supports Collaboration
 7. Branching is easier
 8. Distributed Development

--> The git workflow is divided into three states:

1. Working Directory - Modify files in your working directory.
2. Staging area (Index) - Stage the files and add snapshots of them to your stagging area.
3. Git directory (Repository) - Perform a commit that stores the snapshots permanently
to your Git directory.
Checkout any exisiting version, make changes, stage them and commit.

--> Branch in Git: It is used to keep your changes until they are ready. You can do your
work on a branch while the main branch (master) remains stable. After you are done with
your work, you can merge it with the main office.

--> For Git we need to install in our system.

https://git-scm.com/download/win

--> gitbash

Git Commands:
------------
$ git init (create blank repo)
$ git add . (add the file) 
$ git status (check the status)
$ git commit -m "first commit" 
$ git status

--> Github is a web platfrom which provide us space to upload source code, where we
can create our repo and push to pull our code

https://github.com/

$ git brach -M master
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/saichinna94/Transparent-LoginPage.git
$ git push -u origin master

$ git config --global user.name "saichinna94"
$ git config --global user.email "rapolusaishankar@gmail.com"

--> Responsive Design (media query): 
------------------------------------

@media(media features) {css styles}
   -> common features:
            -> min-width and max-width
            -> orientation
            -> resolution

--> Many CSS Framework:
* BootStrap
* SASS
* Talwind
=================================================================================
Introduction of BootStrap:
--------------------------

BootStrap: Powerful, extensible, and feature-packed frontend toolkit. 
Build and customize with Sass, utilize prebuilt grid system and components, 
and bring projects to life with powerful JavaScript plugins.

https://getbootstrap.com/

--> With the help of it we can create responsive design in very less period of time.
--> Bootstrap is work on 12 grid system.
